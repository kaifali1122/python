## 🚀 What’s Inside

This repository is divided into **topic-wise folders**, each containing multiple `.py` files for individual problems.  
Every problem has its own filename that describes its purpose clearly.

### 📂 Folder Overview

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **fundamentals_and_conditionals/** | Core Python syntax, loops, condition-based logic, and numeric problems. |
| **lists_and_arrays/** | Practice with lists, array-based logic, and iterations. |
| **functions_and_recursion/** | Exercises on functions, modular design, and recursive logic. |
| **strings_and_text_processing/** | String slicing, manipulation, and character-based challenges. |
| **patterns_and_nested_loops/** | Logical visualization using patterns and nested loops. |
| **dictionaries_and_mixed_logic/** | Dictionary-based problems and combined data structure logic. |
| **output_prediction_and_debugging/** | Short debugging and output-prediction problems. |
